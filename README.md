# Image Processing using CUDA

This is my final project for CPSC-479 High Performance Computing at CSUF. This project will perform image convolution operations using Nvidia's CUDA platform.

To run this project:
1. Clone this project
2. Open a terminal and move into the project directory
3. Run "make" to compile the program
4. Run the executable file named "imageproc.exe"
5. There is now a new image named "dogandperson-copy.jpg" in the images folder. This the new image after the convolution was down.
