# Image Processing using CUDA

This is my final project for CPSC-479 High Performance Computing at CSUF. This project will perform image convolution operations using Nvidia's CUDA platform.

To run this project, you MUST have the CUDA platform installed. 
Here are the steps to compile and execute:
1. Clone this project
2. Open a terminal and move into the project directory
3. Run "make" to compile the program
4. Run the executable file named "imageproc.exe"
5. There is now a new image named "dogandperson-copy.jpg" in the images folder. This the new image after the convolution was done.

TODO:
* Implement a CLI
* Use different types of images other than .jpg
* Implement different image convolution kernels
* Refactor image conversion implementation
